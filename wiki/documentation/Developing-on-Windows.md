## Building Crosswalk enabled Android applications

This tutorial goes over the steps for setting up a Windows host environment to build Crosswalk enabled Android applications. 

It will walk you through the following:

* **Installing the GIT SCM tools** - used as a command shell interpreter and for access to utilities like unzip, tar, and gzip.
* **Installing the Android SDK** - necessary for building Android applications. Also provides a hardware accelerated Android 
emulator.
* **Installing Oracle JDK** - necessary for building Anrdoid applications.
* **Installing Python27** - necessary to build Crosswalk enabled Android applications.
* **Installing Apache ANT** - necessary to build Crosswalk enabled Android applications.
* **Download the Crosswalk packages**
* **Build a Crosswalk sample application**

### Install Git Bash
The Git Bash is provided within the Git SCM tools. In addition to Git Bash, those tools also provide tar, unzip, and gzip which 
are also used on this page.

Download and install the git-scm tools from the git-scm website:
<a href='http://git-scm.com/download/win' target='_blank'>http://git-scm.com/download/win</a>

While installing git-scm, select the following options:

Then select Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt:

Once installed, you will want to add various directories to your PATH when you enter the Git Bash session. To do this, open 
notepad, paste the following, and save it as **%USERPROFILE%\\.bashrc**:
```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:${USERPROFILE}/android/sdk/platform-tools
export PATH=${PATH}:${USERPROFILE}/android/sdk/tools
export PATH=${PATH}:${USERPROFILE}/Python27
export PATH="C:/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_40/jre/bin":${PATH}
export PATH="C:/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_40/bin":${PATH}
export PATH=${PATH}:${USERPROFILE}/apache-ant-1.9.2/bin 
```

**NOTE:** If you already have the Android SDK, Python27, Apache ANT, or the JDK installed on your system, adjust the above path 
variables appropriately for your system configuration.

#### Launching the Git Bash session

You can now open a Git Bash session by going to your Start Menu and typing in **git bash** and select Git Bash:

### Installing the Android SDK
1. Download Android SDK:
<a href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download' target='_blank'>http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download</a>
1. Extract the contents into %USERPROFILE%\android
1. Android's **platform-tools** and **tools** directories were added to the Git Bash session's PATH file while installing the Git SCM tools.

1. Run the SDK Manager. You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
cd ${USERPROFILE}/android
"SDK Manager.exe"
```
1. Within the SDK Manager you need to install:
```
[ ] Android 4.3 (API 18)
    [x] Intel x86 Atom System Image
...
[ ] Extras
    [x] Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)
```

#### OPTIONAL: Emulator Setup
If you do not have an x86 based Android device, you can use the hardware accelerated execution manager (HAXM) to provide 
an emulated Android device on your host computer.

1. Install HAXM. The Android SDK Manager will download the HAXM installer, however it does not install it. You can do this in the 
Git Bash session by running:
```bash
cd ${USERPROFILE}/android/sdk/extras/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager
IntelHaxm.exe
```
**NOTE:** The path may change where it places the IntelHaxm installation program. To find this in the Git Bash session by running::
```bash
cd ${USERPROFILE}/android
find . -iname intelhaxm.exe
```

1. Create a new emulator image using the AVD Manager.  You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
cd ${USERPROFILE}/android
sdk/"AVD Manager.exe"
```

For these instructions, we call the image Tablet. Select **Intel Atom (x86)** for CPU/ABI and **Use Host GPU**:

<img src='wiki/assets/emulator.png'><br>

1. Launch the emulator. You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
emulator -avd Tablet
```

1. Once the emulator has loaded, you can use the adb comment to connect to the emulator.  You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
adb devices
```
Which should output something similar to the following:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

### Install Python
Install Python 2.7.x (don't install 3.x as some of the scripts do not support newer 3.x syntax)
http://www.python.org/getit

This tutorial assumes Python is installed into the default location **C:\Python27\**.

### Install the Oracle JDK
Download the Oracle JDK:
<a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html' targe='_blank'>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>

Make a note of the path where you install. If you accept the defaults, it will install to **C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40**.

The JDK's  **jre/bin** and **bin** directories were added to the Git Bash session's PATH file while installing the Git SCM tools.

### Install ANT
We will install ant within the Git Bash shell using the following commands, which will download the binary distribution and 
decompress it to ${USERPROFILE}, and add it to the PATH.  You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:

```bash
curl http://apache.spinellicreations.com//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.9.2-bin.zip -o apache-ant-1.9.2-bin.zip
unzip apache-ant-1.9.2-bin -x '*/manual/*'
```

The Apache ANT **bin** directory was added to the Git Bash session's PATH file while installing the Git SCM tools.

### Install the Crosswalk for Android packages
Now you can download the Crosswalk for Android package, decompress that package, and install it onto a 
connected Android devices using **adb** command. You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
cd ${USERPROFILE}
curl https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/android/beta/crosswalk-1.29.4.1.zip -o crosswalk-1.29.4.1.zip
unzip crosswalk-1.29.4.1.zip
adb install -r ${USERPROFILE}/crosswalk-1.29.4.1/apks/XWalkRuntimeLib.apk 
```
**NOTE:** Passing **-r** will re-install the Crosswalk runtime (if you already have a version installed on your device.)

At this point, if you go to your Android system settings, you should see XWalkRuntimeLib listed in the set of installed applications.

### Building a Crosswalk enabled Android application
You are now ready to build a Crosswalk application!

Download the **crosswalk-samples** source package, decompress it, and then build a Crosswalk enabled 
Android application hosting the WebGL sample. You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
curl https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz -o crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz
tar xvf crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz
cd crosswalk-1.29.4.1
tar xvf xwalk_app_template.tgz
cd xwalk_app_template
python make_apk.py --package=com.sample.webgl --name=WebGL --app-root=../../samples/webgl --app-local-path=index.html
```
You can install the WebGL sample on your device using **adb install**. You can do this in the Git Bash session by running:
```bash
adb install WebGL.apk
```

The WebGL sample will now be in your application listing:

After launching WebGL, you should see the following application:
