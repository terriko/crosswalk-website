## Contributing to Crosswalk
Crosswalk is an open source project. Source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/crosswalk-project). Bugs, features, and issues are tracked using the [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk/issues).

### Building
The first step to contributing to Crosswalk is to get a build environment configured and operational. The [Building Crosswalk](#contribute/building_crosswalk) page provides that information. In addition to the binaries Crosswalk provides for the supported operating systems, the build infrastructure can generate projects for additional platforms. 

### Debugging
Once you have a build environment, familiarize yourself with the debugging process. There are steps describing that 
process in the [Crosswalk Developer's wiki](#wiki/home/for-developers) page.

### Contributing
Now you just need to pick something to focus working on. You can look through the [Issues](http://github.com/crosswalk-project), or hop on IRC and ask what people could use help on.

Be sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](#contribute/contributing-code) as you develop your changes.

### Questions?
Jump on IRC and chat with other developers; they hang out on Freenode in the #crosswalk channel. Details in the [Community](#documentation/community) page.
