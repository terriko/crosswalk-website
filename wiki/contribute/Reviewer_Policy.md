## Crosswalk Reviewer Policy
The Crosswalk project has a special status beyond being a contributor. Crosswalk Reviewers are permitted to review patches and may grant or deny approval for committing.

## Criteria for Reviewers
A Crosswalk Reviewer should be a person who has shown particularly good judgment, understanding of project policies, collaboration skills, and understanding of the code. Reviewers are expected to ensure that patches they review follow project policies, and to do their best to check for bugs or other problems with the patch. They are also expected to show good judgment in whether or not they review a patch at all, or defer to another reviewer.

A potential Reviewer may be nominated once they have submitted a minimum of 40 good patches. They should also be in touch with other reviewers and aware of who are the experts in various areas.

A person who submits many patches but does not show good collaboration skills, code understanding or understanding of project policies may never be nominated. Making unofficial reviews before you become a reviewer is encouraged. This is an excellent way to show your skills.

All reviewer nominations require the support of three reviewers. One reviewer nominates, two reviewers second. Reviewers should be known in the Crosswalk community as a whole.

Reviewers for each part of the project are designated using the same method that the Chromium project uses, 
[via OWNERS files](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/owners-files) scattered throughout the tree.

## Suspension and Revocation or Reviewer Status
Crosswalk Reviewer status can be revoked by 2/3 vote of the reviewers, not including the person under consideration for revocation.

Someone actively damaging the repository or intentionally abusing their review privilege may have it temporarily suspended on the request of any two Reviewers. In such a case, the requesting Reviewers should notify the cameo-reviewers list with a description of the offense. At this point, Reviewer status will be temporarily suspended for one week, pending outcome of the vote for permanent revocation.
